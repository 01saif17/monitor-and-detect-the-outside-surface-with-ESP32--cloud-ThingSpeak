# monitor-and-detect-the-outside-surface-with-ESP32--cloud-ThingSpeak
Send (temperature , humidity ,distance objects ,Gaz vlaue)real time data of sensors(dht11,ultrason,mq2) to cloud ThinkSpeak with ESP32 
well in this project we going to control the outside of our surface and sending the real-time data to cloud ThingSpeak with ESP32 card :
        1--control  the temperature and humidity with sensor "dht11" .
        2--detect if there is some object with sensor "ultrasonic" .
        3--finally detect if there is a dangerous gas in the air with sensor "MQ2" .
